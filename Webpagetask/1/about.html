        <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe 
            centered on a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters 
            that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series,
             short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, 
            was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

            The first MCU film, Iron Man (2008), began Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers.
             Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain 
             America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Phase Four began with
              Black Widow (2021) and concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). 
              Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) began Phase Five, which will end with Captain America: Brave New World (2025),
               and Phase Six will begin with Fantastic Four (2025). Phase Six and "The Multiverse Saga" will conclude
